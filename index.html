This process involves diagnosing and repairing damage caused by frozen and burst pipes, which can lead to significant water damage. The service is essential for maintaining the functionality of plumbing systems in both residential and municipal infrastructures.
      </p>

      <h2>Process & Diagnostics</h2>
      <p>
        The process of repairing frozen pipes begins with a diagnostic evaluation, which identifies the location of the frozen pipes and assesses the extent of any damage. Tools like thermal cameras and electronic leak detection equipment are used to locate blockages and leaks. Once the frozen pipes are identified, the repair process involves thawing the pipes, repairing or replacing damaged sections, and applying insulation or other preventative measures to avoid future freezing.
